FFmpegAdapter README
========

##About
`FFmpegAdapter` is an adapter of FFmpeg, it includes Java part, JNI part and C part; One more thing, **it's possible to debug FFmpegAdapter on `Visual Studio 2013` directly.**

##How to use
* `FFmpegAdapter`: 
	* install Visual Studio 2013 express (or other version, probably work)
	* run win32/ffmpeg_adapter/ffmpeg_adapter.sln
	* DEBUG (or press F5), that's all.
	* And, you'd better check `ffmpeg_adapter_win_main.cpp` first, to make sure the `test_files` folder is not empty.
	* Have fun~ ^_^
